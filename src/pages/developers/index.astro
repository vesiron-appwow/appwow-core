    <h2>For Developers</h2>

    <p>
      AppWow lists Instant Apps — installable web apps that work offline,
      launch like native, and run everywhere from a single codebase.
    </p>

    <p>
      During beta, submissions are controlled to maintain quality
      and establish a clear Instant App standard.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you’ve been invited, use the submit link to send your app for review.
